  <h2>Tell Me More</h2>
  <p>
    Don't panice, it's a real website. Yep, we didn't invest too much in design but you're not here for fancy landing pages.<br/>
    We offers a simple API service that can extract text from images, any image, including PDF files.
  </p>
  <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
  <p>Simeple - post us your image and get a response with the text inside in real time.</p>
  <p>
    request: <code>curl -F "image=@/path/to/image.jpg" http://foo.com?token=YOUR_TOKEN</code><br/>
    response: <code>{text: 'Hello world!'}</code>
  </p>
  <p>Read the full <a href="#">API documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>Yep, that simple. We can fake it and make it look more complex just to charge more, but then we will become like them.</p>
  <p>Not into curl? Try our <a href="#">ruby</a>, <a href="#">node.js</a> or <a href="#">python</a> plugins.</p>
  <h3>Who Is It Good For?</h3>
  <p>Anyone who need to extract text from an image or PDF.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lawyers can scan their documents fast.</li>
    <li>Extract details from a business card.</li>
    <li>Scan and store all your promocodes and paper offers.</li>
    <li>Extract info from bills.</li>
    <li>Anything you can think of.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Pricing</h2>
  <p>That's the place where you can choose 4 different plans where only one actually makes sense. Well, let's save you the trubles and make it simple:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>API CALLS</th>
      <th>PRICE</th>
      <th>INFO</th
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>up to 100</td>
      <td>FREE</td>
      <td>You want to test our service or just play around? You can make up to 100 calls a month for free. No credit card needed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+100</td>
      <td>$5 + Â¢1/call</td>
      <td>You actually have a product that works and have (some?) money. Pay only $5 and then 1 cent for each call. Help us getting there and maybe we'll finally be able to afford hiring a client-side designer.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <a name="join"><h2>Login / Register</h2></a>
  <form action="/login" method="POST" >
    <p>Yeah, never got why you need 2 different forms for that.</p>
    <div style="border:1px solid black; width:300px; padding:5px;">
      <p>Email: <input type="email" name="email" /></p>
      <p>Password: <input type="password" name="password" /></p>
      <p><input type="submit" value="let me in!" /></p>
    </div>
  </form>
